Figured out how to use -lpthread, just include in the makefile. I swear it didn't work a couple of weeks ago when I did that, but now I'll be working on this again 4/25/20

Fixed some stuff, added meaninful comments, deleted random comments. printBuffer() isn't working. Also the if-else stament isnide the *producer, the cout statements aren't printing for some reason. Also item isn't printing out in that same area? I'll look into this tomorrow morning. I would say this assignment is almost complete
