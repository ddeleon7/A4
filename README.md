Let's get this bread

These functions are preventing the rest of the program from working. If we can figure this out, we'll be able to get the rest easily.
pthread_create()
sem_init()
sem_wait()

The directions said use -lpthread, the ways I tried to include when I compiled it didn't work. Maybe I put in the Makefile? I'll let you play around with it. Also I did this in putty because visual studio code didn't wasn't cooperating with one of the libraries.

Also ignore all the random comments I have, I'll clean those up later
