Figured out how to use -lpthread, just include in the makefile. I swear it didn't work a couple of weeks ago when I did that, but now I'll be working on this again 4/25/20

Fixed some stuff, added meaninful comments, deleted random comments. printBuffer() isn't working. Also the if-else stament isnide the *producer, the cout statements aren't printing for some reason. Also item isn't printing out in that same area? I'll look into this tomorrow morning. I would say this assignment is almost complete

Ended up working on this during the evening. But I believe everything is printing out correctly. His example code seems to print out number from 1 - 99 so that's why I have the random stuff set for 1-99. Let me know if any of the code looks funny or if I need to comment any lines of code in order to make anything clearer. Most of the explanations were from the textbook or I just googled what the functions were. Now to write the paper

Looked at the program again and realized it was removing 0, but not stating that it was removing 0 from the buffer. Fixed now. Also when you run the program, don't make the sleep time 1. It ends making our output look funny towards the end of it. Like it says remove 12 from buffer which it does, but there's also a 0 that wasn't in the buffer now in the buffer. Also ocassionally junk values may get printed out when the sleep time is 1. Everything should be fixed now and paper is done.
